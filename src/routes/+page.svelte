				<p>
					Welcome to the Joshua Méndez Harper Lab at Portland State University. Our lab focuses on
					pioneering research in the fields of electrostatics, triboelectricity, and environmental
					monitoring using amateur radio technologies. We are dedicated to unraveling the
					complexities of frictional electrification, understanding the electrostatic phenomena in
					natural systems, and developing innovative solutions for hazard detection and response.

						<h3 class="title is-5">Contact and Frictional Electrification</h3>
						<p>
							Our primary research delves into the longstanding enigma of why insulating materials
							charge electrostatically upon contact. By employing advanced sensor designs, we
							investigate the mechanisms driving triboelectrification in multi-particle systems and
							supersonic flows. These studies have significant implications, ranging from
							understanding volcanic lightning to the behavior of protoplanetary discs.

						<h3 class="title is-5">Hazards and Amateur Radio</h3>
						<p>
							Situated in the seismically and volcanically active Pacific Northwest, our lab
							leverages amateur radio to develop environmental monitoring systems. These systems,
							based on the Amateur Radio Emergency Data Network (AREDN) and the Automatic Packet
							Reporting System (APRS), are designed for rapid deployment and high resilience,
							providing crucial data in real-time across challenging terrains.

						<h3 class="title is-5">Coffee Research</h3>
						<p>
							In addition to our work on triboelectricity and hazard monitoring, our lab explores
							the multifaceted world of coffee. We use cutting-edge techniques to investigate the
							physical and chemical processes involved in coffee production, from grinding to
							brewing. This research not only satisfies our curiosity but also offers insights into
							the broader implications of electrostatic phenomena in granular materials.

						<h3 class="title is-5">Bicycles for Resilient Communities</h3>
						<p>
							Recognizing the potential of bicycles as tools for resilience, our lab is developing a
							fleet of communication-capable bicycles. These bikes are equipped with radios to
							establish high-speed data links, offering a robust alternative communication network
							during disasters. This project underscores our commitment to using technology to
							enhance community resilience in the face of natural hazards.
