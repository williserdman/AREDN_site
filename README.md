# Particle Systems, Electrostatics, and Atmospheric Phenomena Research Project

## Overview

This project explores the dynamics of particle systems, electrostatics, and atmospheric phenomena such as pyrogenic lightning and pyrocumulous clouds in fire-prone environments. It aims to instrument these areas with wireless sensor networks for long-term environmental and fire-related measurements.

## Goals

- Instrument fire-prone areas with wireless sensor networks for long-term environmental and fire-related measurements.
- Utilize Pico Balloons and Meshtastic LoRa devices for data collection in hazardous atmospheric conditions.
- Integrate with AREDN (Amateur Radio Emergency Data Network) network for robust data transmission and collection.

## Key Concepts

The project focuses on understanding and monitoring:

- **Pyrogenic Lightning**: Occurrence and its relationship with environmental conditions.
- **Pyrocumulous Clouds**: Formation, characteristics, and associated weather patterns.
- **Particle Systems and Electrostatics**: Their role in atmospheric dynamics and hazard prediction.

## Project Setup

### Components Used

- Raspberry Pi Pico for interfacing with Meshtastic LoRa devices.
- AREDN network for long-distance data transmission.
- Web server hosted on Raspberry Pi for data collection and management.

## Implementation

### Data Flow

1. **Data Collection**: Meshtastic LoRa devices gather environmental and fire-related data.
2. **Data Transmission**: Raspberry Pi Pico facilitates data transmission via the AREDN network.
3. **Data Management**: Web server on Raspberry Pi collects, processes, and stores the data for analysis.

## Future Work

- Enhance sensor capabilities and add additional sensors for broader environmental data collection.
- Improve data analytics and visualization to better understand atmospheric and fire dynamics.
